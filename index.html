        Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band formed in 1997. 
        Originally consisting of Adam Gontier (vocals, guitar), Brad Walst (bass), and Neil Sanderson (drums, backing vocals), 
        they later added Barry Stock (lead guitar) to complete their lineup. 
        Their self-titled debut album, "Three Days Grace," was released in 2003, 
        featuring hit singles like "I Hate Everything About You" and "Just Like You." The album received widespread acclaim, 
        establishing the band as a rising force in rock music.
        Their sophomore album, "One-X," released in 2006, propelled them to greater fame with chart-topping singles such as "Animal I Have Become" and "Pain."
         The album delved into themes of addiction and personal struggle, resonating deeply with audiences.
         In 2009, Three Days Grace released "Life Starts Now," which continued their streak of success with tracks like "Break" and "The Good Life." 
         The album showcased their evolution as songwriters and musicians, further solidifying their place in the rock scene.
        Following Gontier's departure in 2013, Matt Walst (formerly of My Darkest Days) joined as the new lead vocalist.
        With Walst, the band released "Human" in 2015, featuring hits like "Painkiller" and "I Am Machine."
        Their subsequent albums, "Outsider" (2018) and "Explosions" (2022), maintained their signature sound while exploring new musical territories. 
        Despite lineup changes over the years, Three Days Grace has continued to captivate audiences with their powerful lyrics and energetic performances, 
        solidifying their status as one of rock music's enduring acts.
